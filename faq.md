Please read the questions below before getting in touch.

## What is the Release Radar?

The Release Radar is a post [written on the GitHub blog each month](https://github.blog/?s=release+radar) to showcase community projects that have shipped major version releases. A post is shipped at the start of the month showcasing community projects from the previous month.

## How do I submit my project for consideration?

If you're a maintainer, or a contributor on an open source project, and you have a major version release that shipped, we'd love to hear from you.

Fill out this [issue](https://github.com/mishmanners/github-release-radar/issues/new?assignees=MishManners&labels=&template=release-radar-request.yml&title=%5BRelease+Radar+Request%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) to be considered.

If you need help, or want to see an example of a completed form, you can view [this issue](https://github.com/mishmanners/github-release-radar/issues/1) as a guide.

## What is a major version release?

Major version releases are usually x.0, ie. 1.0, 2.0 etc. Due to the number of submissions we receive, we usually prioritise x.0 releases. However, if you have a x.x release with major (or big) changes we will also consider it.

## If I submit an x.x release, what's considered a 'big' change?

This is your project and your release, whether you are a maintainer or contributor. If you think it's a big change to your project, please feel free to submit your release for consideration. We will still however prioritise x.0 releases due to the number of requests we receive each month.

## How are projects chosen?

Projects are chosen my the GitHub Staff each month. By filling out the [issue](https://github.com/mishmanners/github-release-radar/issues/new?assignees=MishManners&labels=&template=release-radar-request.yml&title=%5BRelease+Radar+Request%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) we can take a look at your project and consider it for the Release Radar.

## Can I submit multiple times?

Yes you can submit your project multiple times for consideration. Please only submit for each major version release. We like to share the :heart: around, so please don't get annoyed if we don't feature _every_ release you ship.

## Can I send media?

If you'd like to send us images, gifs, or videos for your project, please add these when filling out the form. Issue forms support media uploads for images, gifs, and videos. If you need to add images/gifs/video after you submit, drop your media into the issue as a comment. Hint: it helps to add assets to your submission request!

## What if I forget to add something to the form?

If you submit the form, and you want to add additional information, please add this to your issue as a comment instead of completing a new form. Alternatively you can edit the issue.
