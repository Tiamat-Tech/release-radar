This repo is for you to submit your project to be considered for the GitHub Release Radar. This showcase was [published on the GitHub blog until January 2024](https://github.blog/?s=release+radar). From February 2024, the Release Radars are [published on DEV](https://dev.to/mishmanners/series/17046).

The GitHub Release Radar is a post written each month to showcase community projects that have shipped major version releases. A post is usually shipped on the first Friday of the month, showcasing community projects from the previous month. We feature everything from the biggest open source projects to quirky weekend hobbies.

We sometimes select a few projects from the blog post to featured in a Release Radar video. You can [watch the video series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d50L0kJncw&ab_channel=GitHub).

If you're a maintainer or a contributor of an open source project, and you have a major version release (especially v1.0 releases!) that shipped, we'd love to hear from you. You could be featured in the blog, video, and on social media posts.

We can't promise we can feature all projects, but we would love to review your project. Check out the [FAQs](https://github.com/mishmanners/github-release-radar/blob/main/faq.md) for more information on when to submit your project. Due to the nature of the Release Radar, and the number of requests, we only feature [major version releases](https://dev.to/mishmanners/shipping-a-new-open-source-project-have-you-thought-about-release-naming-150n).

Fill out this [issue](https://github.com/mishmanners/github-release-radar/issues/new?assignees=MishManners&labels=&template=release-radar-request.yml&title=%5BRelease+Radar+Request%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) to be considered. Make sure we haven't already shipped the blog post for that month. Ie. the November Release Radar will feature projects shipped in November and will be published the first week (or close as possible to the first week) of December.
