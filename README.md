# GitHub Release Radar

Using this repo to collect projects to consider for the [GitHub Release Radar](https://github.blog/?s=release+radar).

This is under development, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

The GitHub Release Radar is a post written on the GitHub blog each month to showcase community projects that have shipped major version releases. A post is shipped at the start of the month showcasing community projects from the previous month.

If you're a maintainer, or a contributor on an open source project, and you have a major version release that shipped, we'd love to hear from you.

Fill out this [issue](https://github.com/mishmanners/github-release-radar/issues/new?assignees=MishManners&labels=&template=release-radar-request.yml&title=%5BRelease+Radar+Request%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) to be considered.

If you have questions, check out the [FAQs](), or get in touch.
