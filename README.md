The GitHub Release Radar is a post written on the GitHub blog each month to showcase community projects that have shipped major version releases. A post is shipped at the start of the month showcasing community projects from the previous month. We feature everything from the biggest open source projects to quirky weekend hobbies.

If you're a maintainer, or a contributor of an open source project, and you have a major version release (especially v1.0 releases!) that shipped, we'd love to hear from you.

We can't promise we can feature all projects, but we would love to consider your project.

Fill out this [issue](https://github.com/mishmanners/github-release-radar/issues/new?assignees=MishManners&labels=&template=release-radar-request.yml&title=%5BRelease+Radar+Request%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) to be considered. Make sure we haven't already shipped the blog post for that month. Ie. the November Release Radar will feature projects shipped in November and will be published the first week of December.
