# GitHub Release Radar

Using this repo to collect projects to consider for the [GitHub Release Radar](https://github.blog/?s=release+radar).

This is under development, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

## What is the Release Radar?

The Release Radar is a post written on the GitHub blog each month to showcase community projects that have shipped major version releases. A post is shipped at the start of the month showcasing community projects from the previous month.

## How do I submit my project for consideration?

If you're a maintainer, or a contributor on an open source project, and you have a major version release that shipped, we'd love to hear from you.

Fill out this [issue]() to be considered.

## How are projects chosen?

Projects are chosen my the GitHub Staff each month. By filling out the [issue]() we can take a look at your project and consider it for the Release Radar.
