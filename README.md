The GitHub Release Radar is a post written on the GitHub blog each month to showcase community projects that have shipped major version releases. A post is shipped at the start of the month showcasing community projects from the previous month.

If you're a maintainer, or a contributor of an open source project, and you have a major version release that shipped, we'd love to hear from you.

We can't promise we can feature all projects, but we would love to consider your project.
